## Description
The following is an organization created for the TC3002B Advanced Computer Science Applications Development class project. The students were challenged to create a framework that could help the development, testing, and maintenance of web applications. This framework should be able to visually analyze a website and automatically identify any errors, visual bugs, or sudden layout changes with the purpose of minimizing the constant need for human intervention for solving these types of issues.

## Project Proposal
Our project will consist of a Chrome extension that will analyze web sites in real time to identify key elements that will require input testing, for which our program will generate a list of reccomended actions and suggestions the developer can take in order to test their website's behavior.
